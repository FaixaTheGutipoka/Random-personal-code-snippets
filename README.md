# Randoms_personal_code_snippets
Hello there,
This repository consists of random code snippets for tasks and calculations I find dreadful.
Think of it as a programmer's notebook filled with random experiments and solutions to make 
life easier.

Here's a sneak peek at what you might find:
1. Tahajjud Time Calculator (in the 24-hour system): No more manual calculations (when the last third
                                                     of the night dawn prayers!
3.

This repository is a work in progress, so expect new code snippets to pop up as I explore 
and automate more stuff. Feel free to browse around and see if anything tickles your fancy!

Also, most of the codes here are in Python3 and to mention there is no actual project here. 
It just have some ideas which you can take and turn into projects if you wish. Also, if you
find any kind of mistake in my codes (which I do a lot) please feel free to inform me.

P.S.: I am lazy and will write codes for any repeatative calculations  need to do in my day 
to day life, just to avoid using my brain.
